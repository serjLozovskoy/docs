## What goes into the cost of using {{ yagpt-full-name }} {#rules}

### Pricing unit {#unit}

A pricing unit means a single billing unit. The cost of a billing unit is different for text generation and vectorization.

### Text generation {#rules-generating}

Text generation cost is based on the overall number of [prompt](concepts/index.md#working-mode) and response [tokens](concepts/tokens.md) and depends on the {{ yagpt-full-name }} request parameters. Namely, the cost depends on these parameters:

* [Model](concepts/models.md) that gets a request.
* Model [working mode](concepts/index.md#working-mode).

The number of [prompt](concepts/index.md) and response [tokens](concepts/tokens.md) for the same text may vary depending on model.

The number of billing units is based on the overall number of prompt and response tokens and is rounded up to a whole number after applying the multiplier.

#### Tuned models {#rules-tuned-generating}

The use of summary model is charged according to the {{ gpt-lite }} rules. The use of models tuned in {{ ml-platform-full-name }} is charged according to the {{ gpt-pro }} rules.

### Text vectorization {#rules-embedding}

The cost of providing text as vectors, i.e., getting text embeddings, depends on the size of the text submitted for vectorization.

### Internal server errors {#error-request}

## Examples of {{ yagpt-full-name }} usage cost calculation {#price-examples}


### Calculating text vectorization cost {#price-example-embedding}

> In this example, we will calculate the cost of using {{ yagpt-name }} for text vectorization with the following parameters:
> * Number of tokens in the request: 2,000.
>
> The cost is calculated as follows:
>
> 2,000 × 1.0 × ($0.00008/1,000) = $0.00016
>
> Total: $0.00016.

Where:
* 2,000: Number of tokens in the request.
* 1.0: Multiplier for using text vectorization.
* $0.00008: Cost per 1,000 tokens.
* $0.00008 / 1,000: Cost per token.
