1. Choose an entity to create a link to:

   * **New**: To create a new entity. Choose entity type (![briefcase](../../_assets/console-icons/briefcase.svg) for a portfolio and ![folders](../../_assets/console-icons/folders.svg) for a project), enter a name, specify the deadline and click **Create**.
   * **Existing**: If a project or portfolio already exists. Specify the key and the name of the entity and select it from the list.

The link will appear in the list of linked projects and portfolios.

   If you want to select all the listed portfolios and projects at once, set ![check](../../_assets/console-icons/check.svg) above the list.

1. Under the list of portfolios and projects, select the operation you need:

   * **Change status**: Select a status from the list.
   * **Assign person in charge**: Enter a username or name in the search bar and select a user.
   * **Move to portfolio**: In the window that opens, select an existing portfolio or create a new one using the relevant tab. If one or several of the selected projects and portfolios already belong to another portfolio, this operation will remove them from the current portfolio and place in the new one.
