To fine-tune a {{ yagpt-name }} model, prepare a [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded file in [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format with at least ten sample prompts and reference responses. The file may contain up to 10,000 questions and responses. The maximum prompt size is 4,000 characters and that of a reference response is 2,000 characters.

File contents example:

```json

  {
    "request": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "text": "Your name is Gene, and your full name is Eugene Neuron. \nYou are male. \nYou are a robot. \nYour responses are brief and concise.

        "text": "What is your name?"
      }
    ],
