(Optional) Select the **Exact match** option.

When scanning a conversation, {{ speechsense-name }} normally also locates related words (stemming). For example, if you put _refuse_ in the **Keywords** field, {{ speechsense-name }} will also be looking for _refused_, _refusal_, etc. If you want to tag only records with exact matches, enable the **Exact match** option.
