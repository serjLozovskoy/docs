* Tag name, description, and color.

* **Critical tag**: The option highlights the tag when you open a conversation. Tags with this option on inform you at a glance whether or not the recording contains any critical or inappropriate language, e.g., swear words.

* **Keywords**: Use a separate line for each trigger phrase. {{ speechsense-name }} will scan the recording for the keywords and tag it if it finds any.

* **Exact match**: Enable this option if looking for specific words in a conversation. Disable to include related words in the search (stemming). For example, if this option is disabled and you put _refuse_ in the **Keywords** field, {{ speechsense-name }} will search for conversations containing _refuse_, _refused_, _refusal_, etc.

* **Distance between words**: Number of additional words between the words in the key phrase for the conversation to be tagged.
