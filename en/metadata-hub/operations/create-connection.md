# Creating a connection

{% include notitle [preview](../../_includes/note-preview.md) %}

Create connections to user database installations:

* [{#T}](#postgresql)
* [{#T}](#mysql)
* [{#T}](#clickhouse)

## {{ PG }} {#postgresql}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) where you want to create a connection.
  1. Select **{{ metadata-hub-name }}**.
  1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/plug-connection.svg) **{{ connection-manager-name }}** / **Connections**.
  1. Click **Create connection**.
  1. Specify connection name and database type.
  1. Optionally add a connection description and [label](../../resource-manager/concepts/labels.md).
  1. Specify the connection parameters:
     * Database server host address.
     * Port number for connection.
     * For a TLS connection, if your organization has no authorization center (CA) of its own, download a certificate from the CA that had issued the server's TLS certificate. If your organization has an internal CA of its own, use certificates issued by this CA for TSL.
  1. Specify a **Username** for authentication and the method for setting the password:
      * **Enter manually**: Enter the password value manually.
      * **Generate**: Specify the options for automatic generation of the [{{ lockbox-short-name }}](../../lockbox/quickstart.md) password.
