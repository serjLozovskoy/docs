# {{ datalens-full-name }} pricing

## Current pricing policy {#effective-rules}

The service is provided free of charge without limitations on the number of users, sessions, or requests.

## Pricing policy as of April 23, 2024 {#service-plans}

Starting April 23, 2024, {{ datalens-full-name }} is introducing the Community and Business service plans offering different service packages. The selected plan covers an organization and can only be changed by its owner or administrator.

From April 23 to June 1, 2024, you will be able to test these service plans for functionality at no charge. This will help you to choose a plan that best fits your needs. After the free trial ends, [service plan charge](#service-plan-cost) will be introduced.

   * Interactive dashboards
   * Chart builder
   * Data model and calculations
   * Role-based access management
   * Yandex ID authentication

        {% note info %}

        For existing customers who have configured an identity federation and were active {{ datalens-name }} users before April 22, 2024, enterprise authentication and SSO will be available for free as part of the Community plan until December 31, 2024.

## Pricing policy as of June 1, 2024 {#service-plan-cost}

Starting June 1, 2024, {{ datalens-name }} users will be billed based on the selected service plan.

A user is active and subject to billing if their actions have resulted in a query to a data source, e.g., they opened or edited a dashboard, chart, or dataset. Public URLs to dashboards and charts work without authentication and do not contribute to the active user count.
