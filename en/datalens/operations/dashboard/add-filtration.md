# Setting up filtering by charts

To set up [filtering of charts by other charts](../../dashboard/chart-chart-filtration.md) on the dashboard:

1. In the left-hand panel, click ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/dashboard-0523.svg) **Dashboards** and select the dashboard you need. If you do not have a dashboard, [create one](../dashboard/create.md).
1. In the top-right corner of the dashboard, click **Edit**.
1. In the top-right corner of the chart to be filtered, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/gear.svg).
1. Enable the **Filtering** option.
1. Click **Save**.
1. (Optional) If needed, configure a one-way [link](../../dashboard/link.md) or remove links to charts you do not want to be filtered.

   {% note info %}

   By default, the filtering chart is linked to all the charts of the current dashboard tab that are based on the same dataset.

   {% endnote %}

1. Click **Save**.
1. In the top-right corner of the dashboard edit window, click **Save**.
