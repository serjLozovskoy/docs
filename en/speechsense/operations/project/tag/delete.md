# Deleting a project tag

In {{ speechsense-name }}, you can delete space and project [tags](../../../concepts/tags.md), but you cannot delete system ones. To delete a space tag, follow [this guide](../../space/tag/delete.md).

To delete a project tag, you need either the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` or the `{{ roles-speechsense-editor }}` role in the project.

To delete a project tag:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space of interest and select a project.
1. Go to the **Tags** tab.
1. In the line with the tag, click ![icon](../../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and then ![icon](../../../../_assets/console-icons/trash-bin.svg) **Delete**.
1. Confirm tag deletion.
