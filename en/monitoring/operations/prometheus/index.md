# {{managed-prometheus-full-name}} overview

{{ managed-prometheus-full-name }} is a monitoring system compatible with [{{ prometheus-name }}](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/). You can use it to collect, store, and read metrics from your containers, applications, and infrastructure. The system uses the {{ prometheus-name }} data model and the [{{ promql-name }}](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) query language. This allows you to work with dashboards existing in [{{ grafana-name }}](https://grafana.com/grafana/).

{{ prometheus-name }} provides multiple mechanisms for collecting metrics, including [libraries](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) for popular programming languages and support for [exporting metrics](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) from third-party systems, like databases or message queues. {{ managed-prometheus-name }} allows you to use best practices of the {{ prometheus-name }} open source community, while ensuring high scalability, availability, and safety with no need to deploy {{ prometheus-name }} clusters and manage the internal monitoring infrastructure on your own. To get started with {{ managed-prometheus-name }}, just install agents that support the metric [Remote Write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) protocol.

{{ managed-prometheus-name }} is based on the system that Yandex uses to monitor internal services. The system automatically scales metric writes, storage, and reads depending on the workload. High availability is ensured thanks to replication of the monitoring data in two availability zones.

## Getting started {#access}

To start working with {{ managed-prometheus-full-name }} in the current folder, you need to create a workspace. To do this:

1. Open the [service home page]({{ link-monitoring }}){{ monitoring-full-name }}.
1. In the left-hand panel, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.aside-navigation.menu-item.prometheus.title }}**.
1. Click **Create a workspace**.
1. On the page that opens, you will see links to the endpoints to be used for the current folder.

To enable metric [writes](ingestion/index.md) and [reads](querying/index.md) in {{ prometheus-name }} format, follow the corresponding guides.

## Current features {#features}

{% note info %}

The system functionality will be enhanced in upcoming releases.

{% endnote %}


| Feature | {{ prometheus-name }} | {{ managed-prometheus-full-name }} |
--- | --- | ---
| Collecting metrics | [Scrape](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config), [Pushgateway](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/pushing/), [Remote Write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) | Metric writes via the [Remote Write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) protocol are supported. To deliver metrics to {{ managed-prometheus-full-name }}, you can use any compatible metric collection agent, including {{ prometheus-name }} itself. |
| Long-term metric storage | Not intended for long-term metric storage. [Third-party solutions](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#existing-integrations) are used for that. | Long-term metric storage is supported. If [decimation](../../concepts/decimation.md) is used, metrics can be stored for an unlimited amount of time. |
| Reading metrics | Data and metadata reads via the [HTTP API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) are supported. | Data and metadata reads via the [HTTP API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) are supported with some [restrictions](querying/grafana.md#restrictions). |
| Visualization | [Expression browser](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/browser/), [Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) | [{{ prometheus-name }} data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/prometheus/) is supported. |
| Aggregation | Aggregation via [recording rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) is supported. | Supported any existing recoriding rules files in YAML format. Can be uploaded and managed using monitoring console or API. |
| Alerting | Supported via [alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/). | To be implemented in future versions. Currently, alerting rules can be calculated based on short-term data on local {{ prometheus-name }} instances. |
| Integrations | Client [libraries](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) and [exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/). | Existing libraries and exporters can be used. |


## Current limitations {#restrictions}

* The `NaN` value is not supported and is treated as a missing point.
* The `+Inf`/`-Inf` value may be processed incorrectly.
* No support for `alerting rules`.
* No support for `staleness markers`, `exemplars`, and `native histograms`.

## Quotas and limits {#limits}

{{ managed-prometheus-full-name }} has the following limits:

### Quotas per endpoint {#quotas-per-endpoint}

| Type of limit | Value |
----- | -----
| Maximum data write speed in [Remote Write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) format | 500 requests/s and 20 MB/s |
| Number of metrics per write request | 10,000 |
| Number of [Remote Read API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/remote_read_api) read requests per second | 100 |

| Number of unique metrics | 10,000,000 |
| Maximum retention period for [expired metrics](../../concepts/ttl.md) | 60 days |

In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.aside-navigation.menu-item.prometheus.title }}** tab on the right, you can see the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.prometheus.approved.widget-monitoring.title }}** section. Use this section to:

* View the number of written metrics.
* Go to the page with service [dashboards](../../concepts/visualization/dashboard) and view the number of requests, errors, and HTTP status codes per second for various endpoints.
