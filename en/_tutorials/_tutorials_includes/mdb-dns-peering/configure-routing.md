Configure routing between the `cluster-net` and `vm-net` [cloud networks](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) so that any [subnet](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) of one network is accessible from any subnet of the other network.


There are several ways to set up this routing. See the [network routing tutorials](../../../tutorials/routing/index.md). For example, you can [create an IPsec tunnel](../../../tutorials/routing/ipsec/index.md).
