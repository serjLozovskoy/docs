Make sure you have access to [cloud networks](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) in the [folders](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) where the `cluster-net` and `vm-net` networks will reside.

You must have one of the following [roles](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md):
* `admin`
* `editor`
* `vpc.admin`


For information on assigning roles, see the [{{ iam-full-name }} documentation](../../../iam/operations/roles/grant.md).
