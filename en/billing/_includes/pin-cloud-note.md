You can link a [billing account](../concepts/billing-account.md) to one or more clouds. Both new and existing clouds can be linked. You cannot unlink a cloud from a billing account. Instead, you can relink it to a different billing account.

If a billing account is added to an [organization](../../billing/concepts/organization.md), you will not be able to link new clouds from other organizations to it in {{ billing-name }}. However, you will be able to pay for and use clouds from other organizations previously linked to your billing account.
