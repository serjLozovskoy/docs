# Billing accounts

Billing accounts are used to identify users paying for resources in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

A billing account can be linked to multiple clouds and one [personal account](personal-account.md). You can only use the payment method that corresponds to the type of billing account and your [agreement](contract.md).


The relationship between clouds, billing accounts, personal accounts, and payment methods is shown in the diagram below.

## Validity period {#dates}

Billing accounts have no validity period specified.

However, if {{ yandex-cloud }} services are suspended due to arrears and you fail to pay the outstanding amount within 60 days of suspension, all your data, including the billing account, will be permanently blocked and deleted.

You can [delete a billing account](../operations/delete-account.md) if you no longer plan to use {{ yandex-cloud }} services.
