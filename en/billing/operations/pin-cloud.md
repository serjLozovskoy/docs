# Linking a cloud to a billing account

{% include [pin-cloud-note](../_includes/pin-cloud-note.md) %}

## Requirements for linking a cloud {#bind-roles}

Before linking a [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), make sure that the [billing account](../concepts/billing-account.md) has been activated (has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` [status](../concepts/billing-account-statuses.md)) and that the user has all of the following [roles](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md):
* [resource-manager.clouds.owner](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#owner) for the cloud.
* `billing.accounts.owner` or `editor` in the billing account. To learn more about roles, see [Access management](../security/index.md#roles-list).

## Linking a cloud {#bind-cloud}

To link a cloud or transfer an existing one:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ billing-name }} interface {#billing}

   1. {% include [move-to-billing-step](../_includes/move-to-billing-step.md) %}
   1. Select a billing account.
   1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.switch_overview }}** page.
   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.dashboard-resources.section_resources }}**, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.dashboard-resources.button_bind-cloud }}**.
   1. Select the cloud from the list.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.bind-cloud.button_bind }}** and the added cloud will appear on the list.
   1. If you migrated a cloud, pay any outstanding charges on the previous account.

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

   {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

   To link a cloud, a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) must have the `billing.accounts.owner` or `editor` [role](../security/index.md#set-role) for the billing account.

   1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of the resources you want to create:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_billing_cloud_binding" "mycloud" {
        billing_account_id = "<billing_account_ID>"
        cloud_id           = "<cloud_ID>"
      }
      ```

      Where:

      * `billing_account_id`: ID of the billing account to link the cloud to.
      * `cloud_id`: ID of the cloud to link the billing account to.

      For more information about the `yandex_billing_cloud_binding` resource parameters in {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/billing_cloud_binding).

   1. Create resources:

      {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

   After that, the cloud will be linked to the billing account. You can check that the cloud is linked to the account on the billing account page in the [{{ billing-name }} service]({{ link-console-billing }}).

- API {#api}

   To link a cloud, use the [bindBillableObject](../api-ref/BillingAccount/bindBillableObject.md) REST API method for the [BillingAccount](../api-ref/BillingAccount/index.md) resource or the [BillingAccountService/BindBillableObject](../api-ref/grpc/billing_account_service.md#BindBillableObject) gRPC API call.

{% endlist %}

If you are migrating a cloud because you want to stop using the old billing account, make sure the free **Basic** service plan is activated in it. Otherwise, even though it has no linked clouds remaining, you will continue to be charged for the paid service plan.

## Resource management in organizations {#bind-cloud-organization}

1. After your billing account is added to an [organization](../concepts/organization.md), only those clouds and [{{ ml-platform-name }}](/services#ml-ai), [{{ datalens-full-name }}](../../datalens/), or [{{ tracker-full-name }}](../../tracker/) instances that were created in your organization will be available for linking in the [management console](../../console/). You will also be able to pay for and use resources from other organizations previously linked to your billing account.
