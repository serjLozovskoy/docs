# Enabling electronic document management
Businesses and individual entrepreneurs that are residents of Russia can use the electronic document management (EDM) service in {{ yandex-cloud }}.
With EDM, you can get [closing reporting documents](../concepts/edo.md#document).

{% note warning %}

If you enable EDM, you will no longer receive electronic versions of closing documents to your e-mail address and their original copies to your mailing address.
However, you will be able to download closing documents in {{ billing-name }}. For more information, refer to [this guide](download-reporting-docs.md).

## Enable EDM {#connect}

To start working with {{ yandex-cloud }} via EDM:

1. Connect to an EDM [operator](../concepts/edo.md#operator): [Diadoc (SKB Kontur)](https://promo.diadoc.ru/yandexfd?p=z05983&utm_abtest=order-lightbox) or [SBIS (Tensor)](https://sbis.ru/edo/telecoms/yandex). For connection guide, visit the operator's website. {{ yandex-cloud }} does not partner with other operators and does not support roaming.

1. Sign an agreement from {{ yandex-cloud }} in your profile on the EDM operator's website.

   {{ yandex-cloud }} automatically and unilaterally sends agreements to two EDM operators if:
   * A new payer is registered.
   * A payment invoice is issued.
   * An agreement is entered into.

After signing the agreement, you'll start receiving documents from {{ yandex-cloud }}. These are documents generated no earlier than the date of delivery of the signed agreement to the EDM internal IT service. They will be automatically sent to you via EDM before the deadline stipulated in the service agreement.

The originals of the documents generated before you sign the agreement are only sent to your physical address by Russian Post.

You can find the details of the receiving party's signatories of the agreement in your profile on the operator's website. If no information is available, contact the operator's technical support.

{{ yandex-cloud }} does not handle issues reported through user profiles on the operator's website. If you have any questions, please contact [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}).
