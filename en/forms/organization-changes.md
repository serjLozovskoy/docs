# {{ ya-360 }} will no longer be free of charge

Starting April 17, 2023, the free {{ ya-360 }} version will be running with certain [restrictions]({{ link-ya-360-notfree }}). The changes will affect all owners of free-of-charge organizations in {{ ya-360 }}. In this article, you will learn how to continue using {{ forms-name }} for free.

{% note info %}

{{ tracker-name }}, {{ wiki-name }}, and {{ forms-name }} form a single ecosystem, so the change affects all three services. You may prepare for the change within one service only without repeating the tutorial steps for each service.

{% endnote %}

## What will change?

On April 17, 2023, {{ ya-360 }} will prompt the owners of free-of-charge organizations to switch to the paid service plan. {{ forms-name }} remains [free of charge](./pricing.md).

Unless you switch to the paid service plan, you will not be able to edit the list of your organization members in {{ ya-360 }} starting April 18, 2023. You will not be able to add new employees, which means {{ forms-name }} will not be available to them.

## What are the possible ways to use organizations?

You can:

* Switch to the {{ ya-360 }} paid plan and continue to take advantage of all the service features available.
* Stay with the {{ ya-360 }} free plan and manage your workflows considering that you will no longer be able to change the list of your organization members starting April 18, 2023.
* Use the {{ ya-360 }} and {{ org-full-name }} [features](../tracker/cloud-vs-360.md#features) simultaneously.

## How do I configure simultaneous use of {{ ya-360 }} and {{ org-full-name }} organizations?

{% note warning %}

This can only be set up by the {{ ya-360 }} organization administrator.

{% endnote %}

The {{ ya-360 }} organization features can be enhanced with the {{ org-full-name }} features.

1. Create a {{ org-full-name }} organization by following [this guide](../organization/quickstart.md#create).

   {% note alert %}

   After your organization is created, do not open {{ tracker-name }}, {{ wiki-name }}, and {{ forms-name }} until the setup is complete.

   {% endnote %}

1. Send the organization IDs to the service via the [feedback form]({{ link-forms-feedback }}):
   * [Find out the {{ ya-360 }} organization ID](https://admin.yandex.ru/company-profile).
   * [Find out the {{ org-full-name }} organization ID](https://org.cloud.yandex.ru/settings).

You will receive a response from the service once the simultaneous use of your organizations is set up.

All forms you created in {{ ya-360 }} will also be available in {{ org-full-name }}. The form [access settings](./access.md) will allow you to grant edit permissions to the employees of both organizations. Forms that can only be filled out by employees will be accessible to the employees of both organizations.
