# Connecting to S3 using the boto3 library

This guide describes how to connect to an S3 object storage in {{ jlab }} Notebook using the `boto3` library. To connect to an object storage, you can use an [S3 connector](s3-connectors.md):

{% include [fuse-disclaimer](../../../_includes/datasphere/fuse-disclaimer.md) %}

To set up an S3 connection from the notebook code:

1. [Create the secrets](secrets.md#create): `token` (with ID) and `key_value` (with a the secret part of the [static access key](../../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md) for the service account).
1. {% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/ui-before-begin.md) %}
1. Import the libraries:

   ```python
   import boto3
   import os
   from os import path
   ```

1. Enter the name of your bucket in the storage.

   ```python
   bucket_name = '<bucket_name>'
   ```

1. Establish a connection:

   ```python
   session = boto3.session.Session()

   ENDPOINT = "https://storage.yandexcloud.net"

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id=(os.environ['token']),
       aws_secret_access_key=(os.environ['key_value']),
       region_name="{{ region-id }}",
   )

   s3 = session.client(
       "s3", endpoint_url=ENDPOINT)
   ```

1. Enter the bucket name and retrieve a list of objects contained in it.

   ```python
   for key in s3.list_objects(Bucket='<имя_бакета>')['Contents']:
       print(key['Key'])
   ```
