# {{ ml-platform-name }} pricing

## What goes into the cost of using {{ ml-platform-name }} {#rules}

When using {{ ml-platform-name }}, you pay for the use of computing resources: the computation and instance running time is charged per second.

### Pricing unit {#unit}

A pricing unit means a single billing unit. The number of billing units spent on calculations depends on:
* Capacity of the computing resources being used.
* Time spent on calculations.

   The calculation time is rounded up to an integer number of seconds.

One billing unit equals the cost of using one CPU core for one second. The number of units depends on the computing resource configuration.

### {{ ds-nb }} {#dedicated}

When performing computations and training models in {{ ml-platform-name }} notebooks, you pay for the whole time the VM is used since the first computations are run in a notebook until the VM is released, regardless of whether any computations were performed after the first run. If you run computations using {{ dataproc-name }} clusters, they are [charged separately](#data-proc).

You are separately charged for [data storage](#storage) in datasets and project storage expansion.

### Running jobs in {{ ml-platform-name }} Jobs {#jobs}

When you run computations remotely using [{{ ml-platform-name }} Jobs](concepts/jobs/index.md), you pay for the computation time in the selected computing resource configuration. You also pay for [storing data](#prices-storage) required to run jobs: their cache, logs, input data, and execution results.

### Using models {#node}

{% include [pricing nodes](../_includes/datasphere/nodes-pricing-warn.md) %}

### Using {{ dataproc-name }} clusters {#data-proc}

The cost of using integration with the {{ dataproc-name }} service takes into account:
* {{ ml-platform-name }} c1.4 configuration computing resources.
   These resources are created for integration with the {{ dataproc-name }} cluster and are charged while computations are running on the cluster.
* The entire lifetime of the {{ dataproc-name }} cluster according to the [{{ dataproc-full-name }} pricing policy](../data-proc/pricing.md).

Learn more about [integration with {{ dataproc-name }}](concepts/data-proc.md).

### Disk space usage {#storage}

Each {{ ml-platform-name }} project has a free-of-charge storage amount. If you increase the project size [quota]({{ link-console-quotas }}), the entire requested [storage capacity](#prices-storage) exceeding {{ ml-project-size }} is paid for separately. For more information about pricing, see [{#T}](concepts/limits.md).

[Data storage inside datasets](#prices-storage) is charged separately.

If you need to store large amounts of data, you can use {{ objstorage-full-name }}. In this case, data storage will be charged according to the [{{ objstorage-name }} pricing policy](../storage/pricing.md).

[Model storage](#prices-storage) is charged separately. Its pricing depends on the model size that is calculated in GB and rounded up to an integer.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

The monthly usage rate is based on 720 hours a month.

## Examples of cost calculation {#price-example}

### {{ ds-nb }} {#price-example-notebook}

Cost of using {{ ml-platform-name }} with the following parameters:

* **Computing resources:** g1.1 configuration with 8 CPUs and 1 GPU.
* **VM usage time:** 10 minutes.

The cost is calculated as follows:

> 72 × 600 = 43,200 units for VM usage
> 43,200 × 0.0000096 = $0.4147200
>
> Total: $0.4147200 is the cost of using {{ ml-platform-name }}.

Where:
* 72: Number of units per g1.1 configuration.
* 600: VM usage time in seconds.
* $0.0000096: Cost per unit.

### When using models {#price-example-node}

Cost of using {{ ml-platform-name }} with the following parameters:

* **Number of instances per node:** 2.
* **Instance configuration:** g1.1 with 8 CPUs and 1 GPU.
* **Node runtime:** 2 days 3 hours 36 minutes.

Converting node runtime into seconds:

> 2 × (24 × 60 × 60) + 3 × (60 × 60) + 36 × 60 =172,800 + 10,800 + 2,160= 185,760

Where:
* (24 × 60 × 60): Number of seconds in 24 hours.
* (60 × 60): Number of seconds in 1 hour.
* 60: Number of seconds in 1 minute.

The cost is calculated as follows:

> 72 × 185,760 × 2 = 26,749,440 units for running a node
> 26,749,440 × 0.0000096 = $256.7946240
>
> Total cost of using {{ ml-platform-name }}: $256.7946240.

Where:
* 72: Number of units per g1.1 configuration.
* 185,760 : Node runtime in seconds.
* 2: Number of instances per node.
* $0.0000096: Cost per unit.

## Pricing {#prices}

The prices of the configurations are valid for computations in [{{ ds-nb }}](concepts/project.md#mode), [{{ ds-jobs }}](concepts/jobs/index.md) jobs, and the use of [{{ ds-inf }}](../datasphere/concepts/deploy/index.md).
