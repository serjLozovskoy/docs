# Resource relationships in {{ managed-k8s-name }}

[{{ k8s }}](https://kubernetes.io/) is an environment for managing containerized applications. {{ k8s }} provides tools for working with clusters to automate deployment, scaling, and management of applications in containers.

The main entity in the service is the _{{ k8s }} cluster_.

## {{ k8s }} cluster {#kubernetes-cluster}

{{ k8s }} clusters consist of a master and one or more node groups. The master is responsible for managing the {{ k8s }} cluster. Containerized user applications are run on nodes.

The service fully manages the master and monitors the status and health of node groups. Users can manage nodes directly and configure {{ k8s }} clusters using the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console and the {{ managed-k8s-name }} CLI and API.

{% include [Install kubectl](../../_includes/managed-kubernetes/note-node-group-internet-access.md) %}

{{ k8s }} clusters in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure use the following resources:

| Resource | Amount | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subnet | 2 | {{ k8s }} reserves IP address ranges to be used for pods and services. |
| Public IP | N | The N number includes:<br>* **One** public IP address for the NAT instance.<br>* A public IP address assigned to **each** node in the group if you use one-to-one NAT technology. |

## Master {#master}

_Masters_ are components that manage {{ k8s }} clusters.

They run {{ k8s }} control processes that include the {{ k8s }} API server, scheduler, and main resource controllers. The master lifecycle is managed by the service when creating or deleting a {{ k8s }} cluster. The master is responsible for global solutions that are run on all {{ k8s }} cluster nodes. These include scheduling workloads (such as containerized applications), managing the lifecycle of workloads, and scaling.

There are two types of masters that differ by their location in [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md):
* _Zonal_: Master created in a subnet in one availability zone.
* _Regional_: Master created and distributed in three subnets in each availability zone. If a zone becomes unavailable, the regional master remains functional.

  {% note warning %}

  The internal IP address of a regional master is only available within a single {{ vpc-full-name }} cloud network.

  {% endnote %}

## Node group {#node-group}

A _node group_ is a group of VMs in a {{ k8s }} cluster that have the same configuration and run the user's containers.

### Configuration {#config}

When creating a group of nodes, you can configure the following VM parameters:
* VM type.
* Type and number of cores (vCPU).
* Amount of memory (RAM) and disk space.
* Kernel parameters.
  * _Safe_ kernel parameters are isolated between pods.
  * _Unsafe_ parameters affect the operation of the pods and the node as a whole. In {{ managed-k8s-name }}, you cannot change unsafe kernel parameters unless their names have been explicitly specified when [creating a node group](../operations/node-group/node-group-create.md).

   {% note info %}

   You should only specify kernel parameters that belong to [namespaces](#namespace), such as `net.ipv4.ping_group_range`. Parameters that do not belong to namespaces, such as `vm.max_map_count`, should be resolved directly in the OS or using a DaemonSet with containers in privileged mode after creating a [{{ managed-k8s-name }} node group](#node-group).

   {% endnote %}

   For more information about kernel parameters, see the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/sysctl-cluster/).

You can create groups with different configurations in a {{ k8s }} cluster and place them in different availability zones.

For {{ managed-k8s-name }}, the following container runtime environments are available:
* The [`Docker` platform](https://www.docker.com/) is selected by default when you create a group of nodes.
* The [`containerd` platform](https://containerd.io/) may be selected when you create or update a group of nodes with {{ k8s }} version 1.19 or higher.

### Connecting to group nodes {#node-connect-ssh}

You can connect to nodes in a group in the following ways:
* Via an SSH client using a standard SSH key pair, see [{#T}](../operations/node-connect-ssh.md).
* Via an SSH client and YC CLI using OS Login, see [{#T}](../operations/node-connect-oslogin.md).

### Taints and tolerations policies {#taints-tolerations}

_Taints_ are special policies applied to nodes in the group. Using taints, you can ensure that certain pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. For example, you can specify that rendering pods can only be run on [nodes with GPUs](node-group/node-group-gpu.md).

Benefits of taints include:
* The policies persist when a node is restarted or replaced with a new one.
* When adding nodes to a group, the policies are assigned to the node automatically.
* The policies are automatically applied to new nodes [during node group scaling](autoscale.md).

You can only place a taint on a node group when [creating](../operations/node-group/node-group-create.md) it.

Each taint has three parts:

```text
<key> = <value>:<effect>
```

List of available taint effects:
* `NO_SCHEDULE`: Prohibit running new pods on group nodes (it does not affect running pods).
* `PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE`: Avoid running pods on group nodes if there are available resources for this in other groups.
* `NO_EXECUTE`: Evict pods from nodes in this group to other groups, and prohibit running new pods.

_Tolerations_ are exceptions from taint policies. Using tolerations, you can allow certain pods to run on nodes, even if the taint of the node group prohibits this.

For example, if the `key1=value1:NoSchedule` taint is set for group nodes, you can place pods on this node using tolerations:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
...
spec:
  ...
  tolerations:
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

{% note info %}

System pods are automatically assigned tolerations so they can run on any available node.

{% endnote %}

For more information about taints and tolerations, see the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).

### Node labels {#node-labels}

_Node labels_ is a mechanism for grouping nodes in {{ managed-k8s-name }}. There are different types of labels:

* [Node group cloud labels](../../resource-manager/concepts/labels.md) are used to logically separate and label resources. For example, you can use cloud labels to [track your expenses](../../billing/operations/get-folder-report.md#format) for different node groups. They are indicated as `template-labels` in the CLI and as `labels` in {{ TF }}.

* [{{ k8s }} node labels]({{ k8s-docs }}/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) are used to group {{ k8s }} objects and [distribute pods across cluster nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes). They are indicated as `node-labels` in the CLI and as `node_labels` in {{ TF }}.

   When setting {{ k8s }} labels, specify the node characteristics to group objects by. You can find sample {{ k8s }} labels in the [{{ k8s }} documentation]({{ k8s-docs }}/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#причины-использования).

You can use both types of labels at the same time, e.g., when [creating a node group](../operations/node-group/node-group-create.md) in the CLI or {{ TF }}.

You can use the [{{ managed-k8s-name }} API](../api-ref/index.md) and [{{ k8s }} API]({{ k8s-docs }}/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api) for {{ k8s }} label management. API specifics:

* {{ k8s }} labels added via the {{ k8s }} API may be lost because, when [updating or modifying a node group](../operations/node-group/node-group-update.md), some nodes are recreated with different names and some of the old ones are deleted.
* If {{ k8s }} labels are created via the {{ managed-k8s-name }} API, you cannot delete them using the {{ k8s }} API. Otherwise, the labels will be restored once they are deleted.

{% note warning %}

To make sure no labels are lost, use the {{ managed-k8s-name }} API.

{% endnote %}

You can define a set of `key: value` {{ k8s }} labels for every object. All of its keys must be unique.

{{ k8s }} label keys may consist of two parts: a prefix and a name separated by `/`.

A prefix is an optional part of a key. The prefix requirements are as follows:
* It must be a DNS subdomain, i.e., a series of DNS tags separated by `.`.
* It may be up to 253 characters long.
* The last character must be followed by a `/`.

A name is a required part of a key. The naming requirements are as follows:
* It may be up to 63 characters long.
* It may contain lowercase Latin letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods.
* The first and the last characters must be a letter or number.

Learn about managing {{ k8s }} node labels in [{#T}](../operations/node-group/node-label-management.md).

## Pod {#pod}

A _pod_ is a request to run one or more containers on a group node. In a {{ k8s }} cluster, each pod has a unique IP address so that applications do not conflict when using ports.

Containers are described in pods via JSON or YAML objects.

### IP masquerade for pods {#pod-ip-masquerade}

If a pod needs access to resources outside the cluster, its IP address will be replaced by the IP address of the node the pod is running on. For this purpose, the cluster uses [IP masquerading](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/ip-masq-agent/).

By default, IP masquerade is enabled for the entire range of pod IP addresses.

To implement IP masquerading, the `ip-masq-agent` pod is deployed on each cluster node. The settings for this pod are stored in a ConfigMap object called `ip-masq-agent`. If you need to disable pod IP masquerading, e.g., to access the pods over a VPN or [{{ interconnect-full-name }}](../../interconnect/index.yaml), specify the IP ranges you need in the `data.config.nonMasqueradeCIDRs` parameter:

```yaml
...
data:
  config: |+
    nonMasqueradeCIDRs:
      - <CIDR_of_pod_IP_addresses_to_skip_masking>
...
```

## Service {#service}

A [_service_](service.md) is an abstraction that provides network load balancing functions. Traffic rules are configured for a group of pods united by a set of labels.

By default, a service is only available within a specific {{ k8s }} cluster, but it can be public and receive [requests from outside](../operations/create-load-balancer.md#lb-create) the {{ k8s }} cluster.

## Namespace {#namespace}

A _namespace_ is an abstraction that logically isolates {{ k8s }} cluster resources and distributes [quotas]({{ link-console-quotas }}) to them. This is useful for isolating resources of different teams and projects in a single {{ k8s }} cluster.

## Service accounts {#service-accounts}

{{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters use two types of service accounts:
* **Cloud service accounts**

  These accounts exist at the level of an individual folder in the cloud and can be used both by {{ managed-k8s-name }} and other services.

  For more information, see [{#T}](../security/index.md) and [{#T}](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md).
* **{{ k8s }} Service accounts**

  These accounts exist and run only at a level of an individual {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster. {{ k8s }} uses them for:
  * To authenticate cluster API calls from applications deployed in the cluster.
  * To configure access for these applications.

  A number of {{ k8s }} service accounts are automatically created in the `kube-system` namespace when deploying a {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster.

  For authentication within the {{ k8s }} cluster hosting the service account, create a token for this account manually.

  For more information, see [{#T}](../operations/connect/create-static-conf.md) and the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/).

{% note warning %}

Do not confuse [cloud service accounts](../security/index.md#sa-annotation) with {{ k8s }} service accounts.

In the service documentation, _service account_ refers to a regular cloud service account unless otherwise specified.
