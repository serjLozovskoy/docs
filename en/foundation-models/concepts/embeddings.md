# Text vectorization

Computers process all information as numbers. To effectively process texts written in natural languages, AI models convert words, phrases, and sentences into numeric vectors of a fixed size preserving the characteristics of words and relations between them.

The process of converting text into such vectors is called _vectorization_, and the resulting vector is called an _embedding_. Embeddings store information about texts and allow using mathematical methods to process them. You can use embeddings to classify information, compare texts, or search through a knowledge base of your own.

## Models for text vectorization {#yandexgpt-embeddings}

{{ foundation-models-full-name }} provides two text vectorization models. You can access the model's API via its [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI) which contains the [folder ID](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md). The `/latest` option specifies the version of the model to invoke and is optional.

| Purpose | URI | Operation mode |
|---|---|---|
| Vectorization of large source texts, e.g., documentation articles | `emb://<folder_ID>/text-search-doc/latest` | Synchronous |
| Vectorization of short texts, such as search queries, requests, etc. | `emb://<folder_ID>/text-search-query/latest` | Synchronous |

## Embedding use case {#example}

This primitive example demonstrates how you can use embeddings to find the closest answer to a question in a knowledge base. The `docs_text` array contains the source data for vectorization (knowledge base); `query_text` contains a search query. After you get the embeddings, you can calculate the distance between each vector in the knowledge base and the query vector to find the most closely related text.

   * `<IAM_token>`: [IAM token](../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) of the account used for [authentication in the API](../api-ref/authentication.md).
