# Specifics of API implementation in {{ foundation-models-full-name }}

{{ foundation-models-full-name }} provides access to various fundamental models. Each model has its own API.

Use {{ yagpt-full-name }} to perform tasks related to generating text content. For instance, you can select [user interaction mode](../concepts/index.md#working-modes) or estimate the size of a text field in [tokens](../concepts/yandexgpt/tokens.md). For API method and call references, see [gRPC](../text-generation/api-ref/grpc/) and [REST](../text-generation/api-ref/).

{{ foundation-models-name }} APIs are designed based on gRPC. To describe API methods and data structures, one uses Protocol Buffers (proto 3).

{{ foundation-models-name }} does not support a resource-based approach, since it does not use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources. Requests to {{ yagpt-full-name }} are not idempotent.
