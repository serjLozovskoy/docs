# Getting started with {{ yagpt-full-name }}

{% include notitle [preview-stage](../../_includes/yandexgpt/preview.md) %}

In this section, you will learn how to use a neural network for generating texts.

The [management console]({{ link-console-main }}/link/yandexgpt) provides a fast and easy way for new users without a [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) to try out the model with {{ gpt-freetier }} free prompts per hour. To access the API and increase usage [quotas](../concepts/limits.md), [link](../../billing/operations/pin-cloud.md) your billing account to the cloud.

For information about {{ yagpt-full-name }} usage costs, see [{#T}](../pricing.md).

## Getting started {#before-begin}

To get started in {{ yandex-cloud }}:

1. Log in to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If not signed up yet, navigate to the management console and follow the instructions.
1. In [{{ billing-name }}]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure that you have a [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) linked and its [status](../../billing/concepts/billing-account-statuses.md) is `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE`. If you do not have a billing account yet, [create one](../../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. If you do not have a [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) yet, [create one](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/create.md).

- Management console {#console}

   You can start working from the management console right away.

- API {#api}

   To run sample requests using the API, install [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se).

   To work with the {{ yagpt-name }} API, you need to get authenticated using your account:

   1. Get an IAM token for your [Yandex account](../../iam/operations/iam-token/create.md) or [federated account](../../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-federation.md).
   1. Get the [ID of the folder](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) for which your account has the `{{ roles-yagpt-user }}` role or higher.
   1. When accessing {{ yagpt-full-name }} via the API, provide the received parameters in each request:

      * Specify the IAM token in the `Authorization` header.
      * Specify the folder ID in the `x-folder-id` header.

      ```json
      Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token> 
      x-folder-id: <folder_ID>
      ```

   For information about other API authentication methods, see [{#T}](../api-ref/authentication.md).

## Generate the text {#generate-text}

{% note info %}

To improve the quality of generated responses, {{ yagpt-full-name }} logs user prompts. Do not use sensitive information and personal data in your prompts.

{% endnote %}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder for which your account has the `{{ roles-yagpt-user }}` role or higher.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ yagpt-name }}**.
   1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/dice-3.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.yagpt.label_promt }}**.
   1. Describe the request context under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.yagpt.label_instruction-text }}**.
   1. Describe your request to the model under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.yagpt.label_request-text }}**.
   1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.yagpt.label_temperature-text }}** field, enter a value between `0` and `1` that determines the versatility of the model's response. With a higher value, you get less deterministic request result.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.yagpt.label_button-instruct-submit }}**. The answer will be shownÂ on the right part of the screen.

- API {#api}

   1. Create a file with the request body (for example, `prompt.json`).

      ```json
      {
        "modelUri": "gpt://<folder_ID>/yandexgpt-lite",
        "completionOptions": {
          "stream": false,
          "temperature": 0.6,
          "maxTokens": "2000"
        },
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "system",
            "text": "Find errors in the text and fix them"
          },
          {
            "role": "user",
            "text": "Laminate flooring is sutiable for instalation in the kitchen or in a child's room. It withsatnds moisturre and mechanical dammage thanks to a proctive layer of melamine films 0.2 mm thick and a wax-treated interlocking systme."
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      Where:

      {% include [api-parameters](../../_includes/yandexgpt/api-parameters.md) %}

   1. Use the [completion](../text-generation/api-ref/TextGeneration/completion.md) method to send a request to the neural network in the following command:

      ```bash
      export FOLDER_ID=<folder_ID>
      export IAM_TOKEN=<IAM_token>
      curl --request POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
        -H "x-folder-id: ${FOLDER_ID}" \
        -d "@prompt.json" \
        "https://llm.{{ api-host }}/foundationModels/v1/completion"
      ```

      Where:

      * `FOLDER_ID`: ID of the folder for which your account has the `{{ roles-yagpt-user }}` role or higher.
      * `IAM_TOKEN`: IAM token received [before starting](#before-begin).

      The service will respond with the generated text:

      ```json
      {
        "result": {
          "alternatives": [
            {
              "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "text": "Laminate flooring is suitable for installation in the kitchen or in a child's room. It withstands moisture and mechanical damage thanks to a protective layer of melamine films 0.2 mm thick and a wax-treated interlocking system."
              },
              "status": "ALTERNATIVE_STATUS_TRUNCATED_FINAL"
            }
          ],
          "usage": {
            "inputTextTokens": "67",
            "completionTokens": "50",
            "totalTokens": "117"
          },
          "modelVersion": "06.12.2023"
        }
      }
      ```
