#### I linked a bank card to my billing account. When will money be debited from it? {#unlink-card}

If this is your trial period, funds will not be debited from the bank card you linked.
Since you do not automatically upgrade to the paid version at the end of the trial period, funds are only debited after activating the paid version and using {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

If you upgraded to the paid version and used {{ yandex-cloud }} services, do the following to stop incurring charges:

1. Settle your arrears (if any).
1. Delete all billable service resources.
1. Contact [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}) to deactivate your account.

#### I linked a cloud to a new billing account. How do I pay for services now? {#unlink-cloud}

If the [cloud was previously linked](../../billing/operations/pin-cloud.md) to another billing account, check the service usage period.

The payment method must match the [billing account type](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types).
